Goal: Recreate an "Express" like framework using only:
1. the "http.request" API described here: https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/http#implementing-your-own-http-client
2. the Node "net" module

Rationale: This closely approximates what would be required to do git HTTP requests over a pure WebRTC stream
